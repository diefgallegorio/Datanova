        "\n",
        "[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) is an [interpreted, high-level general-programming language](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html) that was first released in 1991. Python allows users to easily manipulate data and store values in what are known as <b>objects</b>. Everything in Python is an object and has a <b>type</b>. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a user aims to store the integer 5 in an object named ```my_int```, this can be accomplished by writing the Python statement, ```my_int = 5```. If you're used to syntax from mathematics, this can seem confusing. In this case `my_int` is a variable, much like you might find in algebra, but the `=` sign is for _assignment_ not _equality_ (the latter is denoted with `==`). So in this case `my_int = 5` should be taken to mean something more like `Let my_int be equal to 5` rather than `my_int is equal to 5`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `my_int` is an example of a _variable_ because it can change value (we could later assign a different value to it) and it is of type Integer, known in Python simply as `int`. Unlike some other programming languages, Python guesses the type of the variable from the value that we assign, so we do not need to specify the type of the variable explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python variables have a variety of data types. If you are used to using Microsoft Excel, this is similar to how Excel distinguishes between data types such as Text, Number, Currency, Date, or Scientific. Here are some common data types that you will come across in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Integers, type ```int```: ```my_int = 1```\n",
        "2. Float type ```float```: ```my_float = 25.5```\n",
        "3. Strings, type ```str```: ```my_string = 'Hello'```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the names `my_int`, `my_float` and `my_string` are arbitrary here. While it is useful to name your variables so that the names contain some information about what they are used for, this code would be functionally identical to if we had used `x`, `xrtqp2` and `my_very_long_variable_name`, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we see (1) <b>integers</b> and (2) <b>floats</b> store numeric data.  The difference between the two is that floats store decimal variables (fractions), whereas the integer type can only store integer variables (whole numbers). Finally, (3) is the <b>string</b> type. Strings are used to store textual data in Python (a string of one or more characters). Later in this case we will use string variables to store country names. They are often used to store identifiers such as person names, city names, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are other data types available in Python; however, these are the three fundamental types that you will see across almost every Python program. Always keep in mind that **every** object in Python has a type and some of these \"types\" can be custom-defined by the user, which is one of the benefits of Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest use of Python is as a calculator. We have seen how to assign values to variables, but we can also carry out computations on these variables. A Python program contains one or more lines of code, which are executed in a top-down fashion (with some exceptions that we'll come across later). The following Python program demonstrates this functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "x = 5\n",
        "y = 7\n",
        "z = x + y -1 \n",
        "print(z)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `print` function simply outputs data to your screen (it has nothing to do with a computer printer, and won't waste your ink or paper!). In the code above, we start at the top and work down. This means we assign the value `5` to the variable `x`, then the value `7` to the variable `y` and finally the sum of the values `x` and `y` minus `1` to the variable `z`. Make sure that you can create this Python program and that you get the output `11` before you continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a lot more to Python than the above. In this case, we will introduce you to more basic Python concepts. If you prefer, you can first go through the more extensive [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) and/or the [W3School Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and practice more fundamental concepts before proceeding with this case. It is highly recommended that you go through either or both of these tutorials either before or after going through this notebook to solidify and augment your understanding of Python."

The ```for``` loop uses a placeholder variable, denoted ```i``` in this case, to store the element of ```country_name_list``` that each loop iteration corresponds to. Namely, for the first iteration of the ```for``` loop, ```i = 'Brazil'```. For the second iteration, ```i = 'Canada'```. And so on until the loop reaches the final element of ```country_name_list```, which it then completes and exits the looping process.\n",

The ```for``` loop process also enhances code readability."

If one countries estimates depend on another, this could significantly complicate the analysis and would likely require a more complex and costly investigation.\n",

        "Regarding answer (c), using a different summary statistic will not solve the problem of having one sample for the statistical calculation.

        "It is common to revisit the source of the data set for a problem as an iterative analysis is performed. Hence, answer (d) is a correct approach to solve the one-sample size problem.  As new insight is gained throughout the analysis, one should always reflect on the data collection process and determine if any new information may help the analysis to move forward. In this case, upon observing some countries having one estimate, it would likely be beneficial to determine why some countries have such small numbers of estimates and if there is a simple, cost-effective method to obtain additional estimates for these countries before moving forward in the analysis.\n"

The summary statistic for Switzerland was calculated with an adequate number of estimates according to company policy. Thus, it is recommended that management explore opportunities in Switzerland for luxury flight services. Jamaica is also recommended as a conservative choice. Although it did not come out top overall, none of the estimates gave it a very low probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, another country that should be closely monitored for luxury flight services is France, which held a 0.66 average success estimate. If there are additional resources in the future for further luxury service expansion, France may be an apt choice, but more investigation should be done to see why one estimate gave France only a 0.2 success estimate."
